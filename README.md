The purpose of most social media apps is sharing things about yourself. They focus on a multitude of things and more often than not, the things people share are visual. They share photos, videos, and links, but music is not something you know right off the bat with people. It usually takes a few conversations to get to know what bands or music someone is interested in. They say life needs a soundtrack, I say share your soundtrack with the app: Decompose. 

Students in high school and college will find Decompose as an easy way to share their musical vibe with others through social media. All they have to do is link their Spotify account with the app, and Decompose will create a word cloud based on data collected by the Spotify API including artists they like, songs they listen to frequently, genres, etc. Once the word cloud is created, they can share this picture through any social media they wish, conveying their musical sense in a very visual, and easy way.
